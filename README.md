# DevCon2017-Breakout-Phaser
Code used in the Phaser demo of my presentation on game development at [Developers Conference 2017](https://conference.mscc.mu)

The code is annotated with my comments for easier understanding while viewing. It is based on the Mozilla Developer Network tutorial [2D breakout game using Phaser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser).

More information about the presentation will be uploaded soon.
